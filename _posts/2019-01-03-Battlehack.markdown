Winner of the Battlehack Athens 2015 with Tekcit team and participated in the finals at PayPal Headquarters at Silicon Valley. 

<h3>Tekcit Face Recognition</h3>
Created an application based on a personalized customer facing application, with AngularJS and Ruby on Rails technology, providing an interface for both mobile devices and the Internet, with support for multiple servers.<br>

A Raspberry Pi computer hosted a NodeJS server, taking the place of a Point of Sales and managing the face recognition of digital photos by users through an OpenCV library. It was connected to the Ruby on Rails application by a Python backend system. Both the application itself and the Python backend were supported by the Heroku platform. Braintree v.zero SDK was used for payments, while SendGrid provided transaction confirmation emails.

<h3>Crocodile</h3>
Created a platform which is responsible for crowd control. Each person in a group is wearing a low power bluetooth beacon and the signal is captured from multiple android devices or raspberry pi devices which are installed on specific locations. 
Each beacon has to be registered with the platform and once it gets out of range of all capturing devices a notification is sent to the leaders of the group.
This has applications on school trips, travel agencies, etc...
