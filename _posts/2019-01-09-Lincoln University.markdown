position: MSc Robotics and Autonomous Systems
location: Lincoln, UK
description: "
The School of Computer Science at the University of Lincoln is home to the Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems (L-CAS), one of Europe's leading research groups in Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS), and a leading UK centre for research in robotics for agriculture and food production “from farm to fork”.<br>
The MSc Robotics and Autonomous Systems is designed to equip students with the advanced knowledge and skills needed to develop the innovative solutions required by the emerging global industry in Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS), and across many other sectors where RAS skills are applicable. These may include agri-food, automation, industry 4.0, healthcare, logistics, military, nuclear, security, and transport. The programme can also prepare students to continue their study in a research capacity, allowing them to further specialise and focus their interests.<br>
Course content is informed by research carried out at the University of Lincoln, especially in the Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems and associated entities, and in RAS and related areas. This aims to ensure that content remains consistently underpinned by the latest thinking.
