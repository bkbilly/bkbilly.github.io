description: "<h3>WeedSpray</h3>
The objective of the project is to have a simulated robot called Throvald to run across the field of crops and find the bad weeds so that it can spray them. With image processing extracts the middle point of the recognized weed and all of the points are published as a pointCloud. Another node gets these points and desides if it needs to spray and publishes all the collected points so that it will be visualized on Rviz.<br>
In order to collect the bad weeds from the images the background had to be removed and then find the weeds. The implementation works with color matching through HSV images, though I also tried with convolutional neural network (CNN).<br>
One option to locate the weeds is by training a model, but this was very time consuming because of the annotation that had to be done. I used this annotation tool though there are many more. For the training I used a tool called mrcnn and followed their tutorial about baloon training. The training took more than 35 hours. The final result wasn't as satisfying as it should and it takes more than 3 seconds to get a result for each picture, so it wasn't usable for a real time application like we wanted.
