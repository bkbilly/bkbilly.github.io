description: "As part of my mandatory military service I automated the soldiers services and leaves using Excel VBA. Also, I was part of the Communication Centre where I automated the distribution of the signals to the served units using Python and Excel VBA.
<h3>Pyrseia Insertion</h3>
A python script was running on an interval that checked for new millitary orders and it downloads them in a html file with the attachments to a folder based on the unit it was supposed to go. The outputs of the python app is read by a Excel document using VBA buttons. It can imported all the information that is needed, also it can print the attachments and the Excel sheet as needed."
