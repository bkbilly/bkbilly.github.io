description: "As part of the software developting team at NeuroPublic, I familiarized and developed applications based on GIS (Raster, Vectors) with data in a form of GeoJSON, Shapefiles, KML. These data were stored on multiple databases like PostgreSQL (PostGIS) or Oracle SQL. Additionally, I had to convert the projection of the geodata to multiple SRID. The representation of the geodata was based on open-source applications while I developed web interfaces using Oracle Maps or Leaflet. Also I dealt with analysis of satellite images where I created a Python RESTful service using OpenCV, GDAL, QGIS. Last but not least, in order to retrieve and process the appropriate data, I used Bash and R scripts.
<h3>Mapviewer</h3>
Using Oracle DB to get vector data and display them through the Leaflet API on a map. The Vector data can be removed and moved on top of the other layers by the user at any time.

<h3>Tree Canopy Extraction</h3>
The user inputs a satellite image, the application finds all the trees and shows itâ€™s canopy as a layer on top of the satellite image.
